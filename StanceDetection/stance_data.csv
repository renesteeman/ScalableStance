"Regulation of corporations has been subverted by corporations. States that incorporate corporations are not equipped to regulate corporations that are rich enough to influence elections, are rich enough to muster a legal team that can bankrupt the state.

"Absolutely it's needs to be defined and regulated in its use, as currently the word 'natural' when used on food products is totally confusing and meaningless. Clearly they are trying to imply the item is 'healthy' or possibly 'organic', but when you see food 'manufacturers' like Frito-Lay or Campbell's with products labelled 'natural', that alone should set off alarms that all is not what it seems. ;-)",healthy,1

"The whole media mess surrounding the royals is a consequence of the promotional fervor with which royal households (aka, public relations experts) developed stage-set performances for the public to devour.

"Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).",prostituion,1
"Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball).",rim,0

"Two of the main reasons people switch to cannabis from pharmaceuticals and other drugs such as alcohol: less side-effects and less withdrawal: ""Over 41% state that they use cannabis as a substitute for alcohol, 36.1% use cannabis as a substitute for illicit substances, and 67.8% use cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs. The three main reasons cited for cannabis-related substitution are 'less withdrawal' (67.7%), 'fewer side-effects' (60.4%), and 'better symptom management' suggesting that many patients may have already identified cannabis as an effective and potentially safer adjunct or alternative to their prescription drug regimen.""

"I have two serious issues with plug-in cars, local and national. Locally, NH has the highest electric rates in the country (thanks, Seabrook). Nationally, plugging in is a huge waste of energy. To get a gallon of gas worth of electricity out of a wall socket, we need to put at least three gallons into the generator. Every time energy changes state, there is a loss: fuel to heat, heat to steam, steam to mechanical energy, mechanical to electrical, and in the car, electrical to battery, battery to mechanical, mechanical to tires, tires to motion. Add that to transmission losses, and you end up with a lot of waste instead of savings. Plug-in cars will add to the problem, not solve it.",electric rates,0

"Ms Ramos don't adult women have the right to decide what they do or do not want to do ? Isn't it equally coercive to restrict their freedom ? I also question the realism of your argument. AFAIK, prostitution seems to be a major sector of every known human society, in societys with strict penaltys (even death) and in societys where it is legal Isn't crimminlization like prohibition - something doomed to failure, as banning prostitution is like banning alcohol, or other drugs, perhaps desirable, but doomed to fail because it goes against human nature ?

"DR Ballantyne- Sydenhams views no longer apply to modern medicine- we have treatments now- like platelet rich plasma, LENS neurofeedback, stem cell therapy, German new medicine, neural prolotherapy, oxidized ATP, MitoQ, ESWT, acupotomy- that you and your colleagues need to learn to help people in pain. No doubt the overuse of opioids has stemmed from the moral laziness of doctors when it came to offer the right care for people in pain. Doctors and medicine is still remiss in developing and deploying good treatment for pain. And training based on the little that pain specialists know and do will be of too little help to people in pain. Its time for Ballantyne to call for raising standards of care for all involved in pain care.

There were no home depots or cell phones to make his life easier. He worked 2 jobs in that terrible economic climate & still managed to build a home & pay all his family's medical bills with no insurance. All with a 9th grade education.

"Only Karina Gallardo mentioned automation. The importation of farm laborers will increase our population and only temporarily provide farm laborers. Hopefully, the children of the farm laborers will be educated and find better jobs. The use of imported farm laborers should only be considered a temporary solution. An alternative needs to be sought. This means that a significant amount of money must be allocated to the development of robots to do the picking. Robots have significant advantages over human including their willingness to do unpleasant jobs. They also may have better ability to detect the ripeness and quality of crops plants. Robots have the advantage of being able to sense light outside of the visible range and to be equipped with ultrasonic and other sensors. One potential benefit of a decrease in defense spending is that some very qualified members of the defense industry could be motivated to work on farm automation.

My school actively promoted me going on to graduate school. 100% of the women my senior class in chemistry went on to graduate school. This is the legacy of a women's college. The women who went to co-ed institutions told stories of harassment in the classroom and labs and found it difficult to obtain letters of recommendation let alone counseling and active support. Men in my graduate school were given forms for grants and scholarships while women were told they were a lost cause as the expectation was that they would soon marry and drop out.

"Mike Tyson ate meat when he was the most feared boxer in the world. He only became a vegan long after his boxing days are over, so he hardly counts as an elite vegan athlete. Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it. You can go up a hill by walking on your hands. Doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way to do it, or even that this is a possibility for most people.",vegan,0

"A ratings system that leads to accountability seems to be the Obama administration's backdoor attempt to control the for-profits, who are, by and large, giving out junk degrees while raking in the federal loans. The easiest solution is to refuse to lend Federal money to students who attend for-profits; however, the for-profit lobby is too powerful in Congress to make this happen. So Obama is proposing a compromise--rate all of the universities and decide on federal loans from there. Like the health insurance compromise that resulted in Obamacare, setting up a ratings system is a messy solution, but better than doing nothing. The growing student debt problem may very well be our next financial crisis, and if a ratings system can prevent it, so be it.",federal loans,0

He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. So even though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected. Worse yet, in many cases they can not get certain work, are relegated to the lower levels of society, yet expected to be productive. So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration?

"The author assumes the conclusion about education on opioids- without providing evidence. Like Ioannidis said we have an epidemic of opinions in medicine today. Some studies have shown that education in opioids improves care. There is also studies showing education on pain care improves pain care. Education on opioids will miss the mark, in my opinion, if the goal is to improve pain care and prevent addiction to opioids. It is clear doctors do not wish to have education in either pain care or on opioids- as statements by the AMA and aafp and efforts by the MSSNY are indicative of. But being a doctor is not a god given right and society has the right to dictate to those who want to be doctors what education they need to obtain and maintain their license.

"Henri Poincaire, the famous French scientist and mathematician, said, 'Science progresses, funeral by funeral'. evidently, so does common sense, (unless it regresses, election by election) and, as the election debates demonstrate, self-interest trumps rationality when the two are in conflict. Enlightenment is the turning away from self-interest to the larger self, that is, social consciousness and class war is not so much between the haves and have-nots in the financial sense as between the developed and the undeveloped in social consciousness. Such development is typically resisted as the growth of self necessarily invokes a sense of responsibility larger than the self; that is, altruism is seen as a perilous loss of self. Thus, in growth, the self appears exposed, vulnerable and at risk. But as healthcare joins medicare, food stamps, un-employment compensation, social security, the FDIC and soon to be measures to end consumer ripoffs and every sort of unethical capitalism, those who have opposed these measures will be seen to be lacking in common sense. For this reason, Henri and I expect to see the members of the Geriatric Old Party toddle off to oblivion with no one to replace them",science progress,1

Airfares on the two airlines are always within 10 dollars of each other. The airfare for a 45 minute flight to the hub is about the same as any flight from that hub to any other destination so the end result is flying costs twice as much than if you flew from a hub. The end result is the hub and spoke system results in lower fares where there is competition and a virtual oligopoly at the end of each spoke. Granted, it is not a monopoly which would cause scrutiny, but the airlines collusion acts like one. Add to that, most of the flying public knows what happens with a weather related problem at a hub.

Nor do parents who send their children to parochial schools save tax dollars.

Public education must plan and staff to educate _every_ child in the district. I have yet to see any empirical evidence to support the idea that home-schooling or private or religious schools save the taxpayers' money.

Almost of of my patients vehemently oppose the use of anti-depressants even when they are clearly indicated. I work with them in psychotherapy, but in many cases the results of the therapy (many forms of therapy, including evidenced based cogntive-behavioral, interpersonal, etc). are quite slow, limited, sometimes non-existent, and there is often relapse. In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well. The problem is not antidepressants per se, its the improper consumer advertsising, further mis-prescription and monitoring of the drugs, and lack of referral for effective psychotherapy in conjunction with meds.",psychiatric drugs,1

I'm old, and when in 1st grade, I contacted German measles. NOT from someone in my class and, in fact, no one seemed to know where I contacted it. I then proceeded to infect almost all my entire class apparently. My point in telling this story is that we cannot know exactly where a child gets his contact, and therefore IMO opinion, vaccinations should be mandatory for every child entering schools from pre-K up. Until everyone - from the child who comes with their parents to America to the kiddo next door, we have to be consistent.",vaccination,1

A greater effort needs to be made to keep them in the Middle East, in nations closer to their home, if not indeed in their own country. THe solution to turbulence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or any other nation, is not that these nation's whole populations go to Europe. No nation should be borderless, allowing entry to anyone who walks in. No nation can accomodate an endless number of refugees or immigrants.

The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous.

"This is a dumb question. The US population is very diverse and becoming more fragmented. We have a two-tier educational system that is providing a decent education for the affluent and a miserable one for the poor or near poor. There is a sizeable minority that is anti-intellectual and anti-science, who feel religion beliefs are being undermined by modern concepts and morality. On the other hand the scientific education provided by the elite graduate schools is the best in the world and better than ever. Unfortunately most of the people taking advantage of that education are either foreign born or first generation Americans. The rest prefer to become lawyers, get degrees in business administration or get jobs in the financial sectors. The pursuit of wealth trumps pursuit of knowledge for those whose families have been Americans for more than 2 generations.

Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game.

"The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball.

Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days.

No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights.,machine,0

Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured.

An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed.

Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise. But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible.,isis,0

They receive decent wages and benefits, are properly trained and take pride in doing a good job. American wait staff tend to be young people, filling time until something better comes along. Their obsequious desire to please doesn't make up for being overworked and improperly trained. Tipping just props up a bad system.",restaurants,0

There was no discussion of the benefits to the environment of being vegan, and no discussion of animal rights or animal welfare. Despite allegations that a vegan diet can lead to debilitating nutritional deficiencies, there is much evidence to the contrary.

"I see a procession of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women in my practice which includes the cure of stress urinary incontinence. I refuse to hitch up the bladder neck of obese women (Body mass index>31). I ask them to lose 30 lbs because 30% will be cured without an operation. I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese ""he could not earn a living (sic!)"". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic. I think employers should discriminate but they should start with the CEO of publicly traded corporations and media comentators. Some of the CNBC crowd is overweight. They should slim down and then go after the CEO's by publishing their BMI's. I think the effects on the general population would be rapid.",obesity,0

"Numbers of prosecutions by the Department of Justice is no indication of the breadth or depth of political corruption. Most corruption in government is accomplished in secret or it would not be successful. Choices are made as to how investigative and prosecutorial resources are funded and allocated. And most actions that the public would call ""corruption"" while unethical or immoral might not be illegal (large political contributions and a ""you wash my back and I'll wash yours"" mentality). Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality. Finally, when legislation and court interpretations are subject to the golden rule - he who has the gold, rules - coming up with an adequate definition of corruption is difficult at best. And successful law enforcement is often impossible.",corruption,0

States, counties, cities collect the property, sales, and other local taxes and assessments which fund the local public schools, libraries, playgrounds, parks, and many other community-based educational and cultural resources. I am puzzled that those who so ardently shout for the preservation of States Rights seem to be inviting the Federal Government into their home to demand oversight of their children's school curriculum and evaluate their performance. Am I missing something here or is there some kind of shuffle going on. I can see the validity of home-schooling or private schooling families requesting an allowance from local and state taxes where control of the costs and expenses for the vast majority of education resides.

The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone.

The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled.

An essay simply puts forth a thesis and allows for a highly selective examination of evidence to support it. I truly believe the rigor of the former is essential in essential to training young minds to think clearly. Perhaps if the Tea Party members had been called upon to write term papers on economics, the nation would have preserved its credit rating and avoided our second slow-down. They would have been incapable of supporting their fiction that giving tax breaks to billionaires uplifts people the 25% of this nation who are underemployed or out of work.",essay,1

Taken to an extreme, burning of books is just the opposite of free speech. It empowers ignorance by destroying the written word.

"I'm not going to defend illegal immigration, it is not correct from any point of view, it should be in the right way, complying with all the law requirements. What I see is that it is supported by the demand created for the employers that at the end are the big winners of everything. The fact that the immigrants are not paying taxes or surviving with their lower wages, are not making them millionaires, and also, the 11 million figure doesn't mean that there are 11 million in the workforce, the numbers are way lower. Anyway, this illegal affluent should stop, therefore the law enforcement should be more focus in the punishment for the employers, thus, the problem will be cut from the root. In regards to the legalization of the 11 million, we all American should not be afraid, they are not gonna take any more jobs, they just gonna continue doing their jobs and being taxed.

Now that they are grown up and on their own, we have the time (and money) to take trips by ourselves. My dad always wanted to drive cross country with us (or to conserve time, to fly to Denver and drive to California). Because money was tight, we never took that trip. At the end of his life, one of his only regrets was that we never took that drive as a family. ""In the long run, the cost was nothing - but think of the fun we would have had!""",drive,1

One could also argue that the tax on labor is a disincentive to work, but for some reason that seems to have less traction - could it be because wealthy people - whose right to speak more loudly than the rest of us was recently codified by the Supreme Court - are less concerned about it?

"So pervasive must be the assumption that loyal (American) nationalism is a good thing, that none of the commentators mentioned the negative aspects of the nation state. I tend to agree with Orwell: "" A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist - that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating - but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations."" By refusing exclusive loyalty to one nation, the dual nationalist waters down excessive nationalism - which, in its extreme form, can easily slide into fascism. With two or more perspectives, the dual nationalist can more easily see the strengths - and the flaws - within the country in which he or she is residing. The dual nationalist, in particular, realizes that most claims of American exceptionalism are baseless.",nationalism,1

"Many TFA folks are feeling defensive these days, and rightly so. The program promises more than it can deliver. It is not the fault of these idealistic and/or ambitious young people that the program has been overly touted as the silver bullet for all education's problems. There is nothing wrong with leaving education after two years, becoming an administrator or going to law school. The problem is that attrition is basically a design feature of the program. An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years. I almost did, until I realized that I needed to set boundaries and have a life. The problem is that students pay by losing energetic teachers every year, would-be teachers are discouraged and leave the classroom, and the taxpayers are footing too much of the bill for a program with questionable returns. There needs to be an overhaul if the public is to be expected to continue supporting a program that is not successful in helping create long term stability in schools.",tfa,0

I'm not thrilled that a meal for 2 in NY (with app, entrees, and drinks) can be as much as $100 at mid-range places. A tip is to congratulate a job well done.

Employees should be free to move or sell their talents to the highest bidder. A time restricted none compete that's enforced through compensation by the former employer who wishes to restrict the employee seems like reasonable protection for both sides. The employee can't work for a year or two in their most lucrative field but the employer who wishes to restrict them pays them a portion of their lost wages for the period of enforcement. A free market for goods and services includes labor. A none compete does more than protect intellectual property it suppresses wages and creates a sense that the employee is property of the employer if they wish to stay in the field were they have the most experience and potential value.,employer,1
"The way I see it, it is better for people to have children later in life than sooner. From an evolutionary point of view, to be the child of parents that were in their 40s when they had you means that (a) both your parents survived until their 40s and (b) they were fertile too in their 40s. So, genetically, the offspring's chances to atteign - at least - that age and be also able to reproduce at that age are increased. Give it a couple of centuries of that policy and it could rise humanity's (at least in the western world) life expectancy by raising, among others, our reproductive expectancy.",child,1

Only 8 percent of college men and 5 percent of college women participate in those sports. The data also show that intercollegiate sports programs are quite expensive.

Mr. Clotfelter assumes that big-time competitive sports can only function as they are currently structured. He states that ""there is no going back."" How about going forward? How about spinning off the profit makers (men's football and basketball) as university-owned semipro operations totally independent of the NCAA and educational regulations?

These are people I've never seen before, I go to places I've never visited; and everything, just everything is splashed in vivid, deep color. I'm often in awe of the sheer majesty or ingenuity around me. Sometimes I stand and admire a shape, or look at a landscape, or marvel at a color. I also invent gadgets, the formulas of which I unfortunately forget just after I wake up, but I do remember a couple being pretty brilliant! The interesting thing is that when I've had sad spells in my life, my dreams have been very happy, offering me refuge for a few hours, but sometimes during happy periods, my dreams have been deeply disturbing.

"Contrary to Fulsom's assertion that agricultural subsidies arrived in the present in a time capsule sealed by FDR himself, the truth is that most modern agricultural subsidy programs were heavily re-engineered into their current states during the Nixon administration by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. His mantra to farmers--""get big or get out""--may or may not have been a direct political response to rising food prices in the early 1970s, but the fact remains that it incentivized the rise of the massive agribusiness and the modern era of industrial agriculture. The irony that Fulsom fails to mention is that modern industrial agriculture in the US is not tooled to survive and thrive without these subsidies. If subsidies are to be eliminated--which I hope to see--the US will need to shift its agricultural paradigm away from industrially grown monoculture.",subsidy,1

Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now?

What is being overlooked in this discussion is the insight parents can get into so many aspects of their child's development including: 1) Academic progress in different subjects 2) Developing interests in potential careers 3) Relationships with teachers and even school peers 4) Early warnings of problems in school or more personal issues. Hints about all these issues can be discerned by the parent who takes time to help their children with homework which can even be just a guise for LISTENING.

My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone.

Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good.

In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre.

This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs.

They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics.

I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is.

Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white.

That is, I search news sites, (this one primarily and a few others to a lesser degree) to find out what is happening in the world. In doing so, I learn about things that I most likely would never discover on my own because I didn't know they existed. Much of the under 40 crowd is oblivious to my news world. They only know of news that hits their Facebook page. The news comes to them. They don't seek out the news. They are passive consumers while I am active. In doing so, the range of information they are exposed to is highly limited. This is dangerous for an open society. Being fed bits and pieces of news based upon browsing history, buying habits, or selection fields greatly restricts what goes into ones head. Reading a newspaper is an act of discovery. Being fed a restricted news stream is a path toward puppetry.",newspapers,1

While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income.

"We need objective information about different Universities/Colleges but I think the type of information the Obama Admin wants wont be that useful. Most reputable charities provide information on the percentage of their funds are spent on administration and what percentage is spent on charitable activities. I think the most useful rating system that could be enacted is one that provides information on what percentage of tuition is spent on administrative salaries and non-instructional costs and what is spent on instruction. Instruction would include: libraries, technology in classrooms, faculty salaries, advising etc. Administrative salaries, fancy food courts, fancy health clubs and the endless numbers of Vice Presidents would be excluded from Instructional Costs. I am a faculty member at public university and I have not had a raise in almost 8 years.

But somewhere along the way vegans decided to also try to make the argument that it's the healthier life choice, which is progressively being proven to be wrong. It's fine to decide to be a vegan. The fact that it's not the healthiest alternative only makes the moral choice more courageous. Nonetheless, I agree with the author that such decisions should not be imposed on children.",vegan,1

"I believe that moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would satisfy one of Mr. Trump's prime addictions. Namely, an addiction to chaos--and attention. Creating constant chaos in one way or another is how he's occupied the front pages worldwide--and has for months and no doubt will continue at least for the next four years. The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise. For example, moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would stir up all kinds of chaotic problems and fires that would have to be put out. And while Mr. Trump might call doing that being anti establishment. I would call it partly or wholly feeding an addiction.",jerusalem,0

"I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time.

Companies are taking few steps to protect themselves from having sensitive consumer information hacked because they have no obligation to safe guard that information and no liability if it gets stolen and used to the consumers detriment. Corporations always object to telling consumers the truth about anything from whether or not their food contains GMO to whether their personal information has been stolen by a hackers. The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly. Corporations should be required to notify consumers immediately if their information has been stolen and should be required to provide protection to those consumers from identity theft and compensation if it does that includes any losses and the cost of cleaning up the mess.

"Historically, the kind of sentimental nationalism expressed by Mr. Krikorian is a relatively recent phenomenon, and in its more potent forms -- as, for example, considering citizenship as intense as marriage, 'till death do us part' -- has often been a source of dangerous emotional politics and policy-making. Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others. Nationalism, and the intense 'marriage-like' sense of citizenship that it engenders, is a double-edged sword: valuable in moderation, dangerous when exaggerated, as Mr. Krikorian does.",citizenship,0
"I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure.

I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers.

"I have worked as a school librarian for over ten years so of course I don't think librarians are expendable but, it is not just personal. Librarians teach among other things, finding and evaluating information. This skill is of tantamount importance. It is needed throughout life. It's a skill that is used for everything from deciding what movie to see to deciding where to buy your next home. Classroom teachers have less and less time to teach anything that is not evaluated on a standardized test. This is what No Child Left Behind has wrought. Lawmakers and administrators are very short-sighted if they think that eliminating school librarians will have little impact on their students. As Samuel Johnson stated ""Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it."" Without librarians, who will teach students how to find it?",school librarians,1

"One thing that many young women may not realize is just how hard IVF is. I was very lucky that my IVF was mostly covered by insurance and that I got pregnant after a single round. But I was surprised by the toll that fertility treatments took on me personally and professionally. The shear number of clinic visits made the process highly time-consuming, and the side effects of the medications interfered with my ability to be productive at work. So if it feels inconvenient to balance children with work at a younger age, keep in mind that the longer you wait, the greater the chances that you will need fertility procedures that are inconvenient and career-impacting in of themselves... and that's all before the baby actually arrives!",ivf,0

If you graduate from law school, you're golden. While we are at it, why are contracts, court opinions, and legal documents and procedures so difficult and complicated? We should really simplify all things legal. In fact, why do you need to be an attorney to represent others in a court of law or with important documents? Anybody should be able to do it and get paid handsomely as well. Next, we should examine why medical schools, internships and residencies so selective. Also, why are CPA certifications so difficult and time-consuming?",law school,1

"Here's the deal with home birth as opposed to hospital birth. From this essay, ""Life-threatening emergencies that are not predictable are extremely rare - although they do occur both at home and in the hospital at roughly equal rates."" So when a life-threatening emergency occurs at a hospital, the mother and baby have a pretty good chance of surviving it, or as good as possible anyway. When such occurs at home, the odds are good that the mother and/or baby will die. So home births are less safe. They're usually safe, sure, because these emergencies are rare. But they're less safe than hospitals and always will be.",home birth,1

These other governments would expect any Palestinian government to prevent attacks by its citizens on Israel or any other country.

Of course, they have to rally behind the policy to the extent that they will help the police track and stop extremists, even if the extremists are relatives. But in the West Bank this has been pretty much achieved. If Israel could abandon some of its settlements and prevent any terrorism by extremists who opposed this abandonment, and Palestine could prevent terrorism by extremists who opposed the recognition of Israel, we would have something workable.",israel,1
"In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons. Forcing a gifted poet into the sciences produces a substandard physicist, but encouraging her to use her talents to contribute can produce an effective professor of literature - and perhaps a poet laureate.",child,0
"It's really not enough to say ""we need more information"". Most information available from the medical profession and from the government is just plain wrong.

"This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses.

We should distance ourselves from both Israel and the Palestinians and pursue normal relations with other Arab countries like Tunisia and Oman on their own merits, not as part of a worldview that makes everything revolve around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict is central to Israel, but not to the US.

"My son contracted pertussis at the age of 45. I suffered a spider bite and he accompanied me to a clinic in Australia (we were there on holiday) and he apparently contracted the disease in the waiting room. Adults who lived in the Australia were urged to receive a booster because of an epidemic they were experiencing at the time. Obviously, there were some people in the waiting room who had not been vaccinated. Chris, my son, was living in London at the time and the adults there were not reminded to be re-vaccinated. Although my son was a healthy adult, he was ill for over a month with pertussis. Not only was he unable to actively enjoy his vacation but he was unable to travel back to London to work until his illness resolved. Luckily his two very young children had been vaccinated and he was the only one in the family who got sick. This particular communicable disease can be fatal, especially for young children or those who are immune suppressed. If you don't want your children to be vaccinated you may want to think of others who may suffer from your decision.",pertussis,1

Similarly, we are asked to believe that talent, expertise, and wisdom in the realm of education is offered by wealthy philanthropists, corporate executives, consultants, and government officials, but not by those who actually teach students. Unfortunately, there's just too much potential profit to made to allow public education in its present form to remain.

Meanwhile, the librarians-who are usually the only professionals in the school with notable training in research methods-go along quietly, educating students about how to tell a source from a delusion.

Speaking as a teacher, we are also making teaching an even less appealing profession. We already have to accodomate and modify based on IEPs and languages, and mandated testing. What other profession gets so much input from those outside the profession? Do people go to their doctors and tell them how to treat their problems? Give advice to their lawyers or accountants?

European countries, followed by their western colonies, profited from this trade for several hundred years....a blot on their history, no doubt. But when they discontinued their part in the trade, and actively (in the case of Britain) sought to suppress it, there was an angry reaction from the indigenous rulers of West Africa, because slavery was the mainstay of their economies. The trade continued unabated (if perhaps less lucratively), as slaves were sold to the North African and Arab states, right up to the 1960s. The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial. So if there is to be compensation, perhaps it should come first from Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and other West African countries....that is, from the descendants of those who sold so many of their so-called brothers and sisters into bondage, for as long as the rest of the world allowed it.",slavery,0

But, In Japan where most restaurants forbid employees to accept tips the service is good but with one exception: the servers will never break the house rules.

Some of the reduction in admittance rates results from the fact that a larger number of students from out of state are admitted in order to capture more revenue. Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year. The impact is serious--they attend lesser in-state schools, go to out-of-state public universities, or they attend private schools. The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy. The State of California ends up with a large number of students who are less educated, have higher debt rates, or leave the state permanently.",uc system,1

But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited.

"Language study is about more than language study; it has long been and remains at the heart of the humanistic disciplines. This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary.

"Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school. Made the Dean's list which amazed both her grandparents and her mother! Took very little with 'light' semi hands on guidance from me. The obvious road block/hinderances were her mother and lazy retired grand parents. Today, she serves with distinction in the Air Force, is married and has a new child.",marriage,1

Overall, out of the 12-15 million Africans transported to the Americas, less than 4% ended up in British North America or the subsequent US.

"We should have consumption (sales or VAT) taxes and capital gains taxes should be 50 percent declining one percent per quarter reaching zero in 12 1/2 years.

Most current deductions other than catastrophic loss should be eliminated. Charitable deductions should be more limited if not eliminated, especially for organizations that propound political positions (churches that mention politics, policy think tanks, and all political advocacy groups).

If one looks objectively, disregarding personal taste, whether it is a Gehry, a Nouvel or Isozaki building here in New York - they all stand out as impeccably executed architecture. Most of them relate to their context (see the formal empathy between the Beekman Tower and Woolworth Building, for instance), or creating a new one where such context is either weak or lacks character.

Farm subsidies grossly reward a small-percentage of large-scale corporate farms and businesses, which now operate on scales in vast disproportion to the revered Jeffersonian single-farmer business. Farm subsidies indirectly support major pharmaceutical companies through chemicals, oil industries (fertilizer), and diesel production/ports; a very nationalist enterprise in an era of which America is the self-proclaimed champion of global free markets and force tariff removals. There are only two kinds of farmers: those selling their land and millionaires...there is little in-between in this industry...which also can no longer survive in a free market...commcercial farming has, in the words of a famous person, become 'too big too be allowed to fail.'",fertilizer,1
"True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila!",elite restaurants,1
"The whole idea of sainthood is absurd. Which evolved ape is worthy of veneration? Maybe Dorothy Day. Certainly not Mother Theresa nor John Paul II. On top of that, the Catholic Church has provided a bureaucratic process to vet the applicants including proof of two miracles, which are usually a sham to push through the desired prospect. Who on earth would venerate dictators, corrupt financiers and evil bishops? Only the Catholic Church! Next they will be canonizing Scalia. Instead of picking the Catholic All-Star team, when will the Catholic Church celebrate the beauty and weaknesses of ordinary human beings?",catholic church,0
"We are reaping the long term rewards of the 60's hippie overthrow of our culture and values system. The ""hippies"" are now running our education systems and our entertainment business. They instituted relative morality, anyone over 30 is a fool, free love for all,,burn the flag and pi** on America etc. It takes decades for these moral abandoments to filter through society but now rudeness, in-your-face encounters, ignorance is bliss, hit-and -run hook up romance, are the standard forms of intercourse, public and private. We can blame only ourselves. The result of the Cold War was that socialists realised that no one could beat America with military force, but our education system was ripe for plucking. With political correctness and debasement of American pride and self worth, they won. We have ""fallen down and can't get up"".",culture,0
"Funny how these things work. Employers pay people as if they're worth nothing, but force them to sign non-compete contracts because they might have the know-how to ruin the company's business. If that isn't worth something, what is? Maybe those small business owners should find better ways to encourage people not to walk off with trade secrets, like treating underlings with respect, paying a living wage, and sharing the profits. Might help.",wage,0
"As degrading and horrible as the act of human trafficking was during the transatlantic slave trade, nothing can be done to heal that wound. At the time it was acceptable; when the New World was discovered, once America declared it independence, slavery was abolished after much 'kicking and screaming'. Consider this: IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM excusing the action, the benefit derived was the citizenship and cultural influence in helping shape the country - both good and bad. While the black community makes up ~18% of the population, issues like illegal immigration and immigration reform have a large impact on the economic well-being in the minority precincts around the country. The white-Hispanics who want open borders and demand job opportunities when they're not US citizens are the ones haranguing the legislators about amnesty and work permits. Issuing work permits and SSNs will only create more identity theft and fewer employment opportunities for the minority community. Is that any kind of reparation?",reparations,1

"""The international community will not invest power, prestige and funds to chaperone an artificial ""state"" Oh yes they will, just as they approved another $5.8 billion to rebuild Gaza. Let's not pretend the millions of Westerners who sympathize with the Palestinians hold no sway with their governments, and that the Arab world doesn't care about Palestinians because that is patently false, or perhaps wishful thinking. But, if that is really your 'concern' for Palestine, then why doesn't Israel help out by donating the $3  billion per year it receives in US foreign aid? Why wait for others when Israel is a ""modern marvel"" of riches in the desert? Write the first check, I say! Isn't the real problem here that Israel is having a meltdown because the world is becoming increasingly aware of their appalling treatment of Palestinians and thus may interfere with Israel's ultimate plan to annex all of the West Bank and sever Gaza?",gaza,0
"Diisasters can strike everywhere in the U.S. Floods, fires , tornados, hurricanes can strike a single state or an entire region. Why should it be the responsibility of a state to bear the brunt of the cost.

"It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.",tip,0

"I'd just like to see the curriculum. Too many times, the syllabus for any given course is behavior focused with no mention of the topic material to be covered. I also have to agree with one of the commentators below. Language Arts and similar classes are not academically challenging for good readers because of the need to accommodate those who struggle. I don't object to helping those who struggle but I would certainly let my child opt out of classes where he/she does not learn anything new. I'd also opt out of the character education training, which too often, requires students to respect everyone's opinion.",curriculum,1
"Analogies are a weak form of argument, but the parallels in predicting medical outcomes and those used to predict criminality are inherently the same. In both instances the goal is predictive accuracy. Statistical functions, such as logistic regression and odds estimation models are not inherently good or bad. A researcher may think that if one can predict medical or sociological outcomes, then one understands them, but that is not the case. Statistical correlation may not demonstrate causality, but it directs our attention to possible causal factors--such as the link between smoking and cancer. Thus the use of probability models in criminality studies is heuristic and acceptable. First, demonstrate a statistical association, and then try to identify and construct a causal model.",statistic,0

The issue is what do I have to pay for the bankers to have the privlege of using my money to make a profit. In older times they went out and made good investments.

"I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.",syria,0
"Only 40 women's colleges are left in the U.S. And, while there are a variety of opinions on their value, to the women who have attended (and do attend) them, they have been (and continue to be) tremendously valuable.

"Back in the day when I had my own office I could display artwork, plants, photos, and make my workspace an oasis where I enjoyed spending time. And I could welcome others in to share that space with me. The open plan destroyed individuality. It is DE-HUMANIZING. I now have no place to keep my possessions. Collaboration is DISCOURAGED because people can't sit comfortably together and talk for any length of time. In an open space, most people keep headphones on to shut out distractions. I find that when there are no walls, people build their own, just to keep sane.",office layout,2
