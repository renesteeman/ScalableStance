States that incorporate corporations are not equipped to regulate corporations that are rich enough to influence elections, are rich enough to muster a legal team that can bankrupt the state. Money from corporations and their principals cannot be permitted in the political process if democracy is to survive.   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Absolutely it's needs to be defined and regulated in its use, as currently the word 'natural' when used on food products is totally confusing and meaningless. Clearly they are trying to imply the item is 'healthy' or possibly 'organic', but when you see food 'manufacturers' like Frito-Lay or Campbell's with products labelled 'natural', that alone should set off alarms that all is not what it seems. ;-)   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \"...one must ask how much money they must make to demonstrate that they are among the best managed companies on the planet.\" They must make enough money to insure that they can never fail and threaten the stability of the worlds economy again.

Prior to the Victorian era, those elaborate and lethally expensive weddings, coronations, and funerals - and the fairy tales that went along with them - just didn't exist.   \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).   \n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ...   \n1716                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Allowing maximum access does not cause maximum use.

This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.   \n1719                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Only 40 women's colleges are left in the U.S. And, while there are a variety of opinions on their value, to the women who have attended (and do attend) them, they have been (and continue to be) tremendously valuable.
