Use the mongoDB tools
Use the guide for exporting a table located in the bin folder ('how to export.txt') (the database is the one used by mlbias.com which caches the articles on load, this site is owned by Ren√©)
articles.csv will give you all the headlines, filter these for English only and headlines only (no search query)
Label these articles as fit and save the resulting csv in pipeline/data/RoundedLabelled (stance of 1 is against/negatie, 2 is neutral/mixed, 3 is in favor/positive)
Run pipeline/UploadTrainingData
The model will automatically use the new training data to improve itself!
